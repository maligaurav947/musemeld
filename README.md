## Prerequisites

Before getting started with MuseMeld, ensure you have the following:

2. Firebase project with Firestore, Authentication, and Storage services set up.

## Getting Started

To run MuseMeld on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/musemeld.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd musemeld
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

5. Set up Firebase credentials:

   - In your Firebase project settings, navigate to the "General" tab.

   - Scroll down to the "Your apps" section and select the web app you've created.

   - Click on the "</>" icon to add a web app to your project.

   - Give your app a nickname, and make sure to check the option to "Register app" for Firebase Hosting. This will provide you with a configuration object.

   - Copy the configuration object and replace the content in your `src/firebase.js` with the new credentials:

   ```javascript
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
     authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
